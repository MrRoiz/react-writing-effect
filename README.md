|style|Css styles to use in the whole component|React.CSSProperties|undefined|N/A|
|onFinish|A callback used at the end of current animation|Function|undefined|N/A|
|cursor|If you want to use a custom blinker you're able to using this prop|JSX.Element|undefined|N/A|
|styleText|Css styles to use just in the text of the component|React.CSSProperties|undefined|N/A|
